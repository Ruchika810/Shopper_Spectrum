**Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation in E-Commerce using Machine Learning**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Shopper Spectrum is an end-to-end data science project that segments customers based on their shopping behavior using RFM analysis and clustering techniques. It also features a recommendation system that suggests similar products using item-based collaborative filtering.

The final application is wrapped into an interactive Streamlit app that lets users explore both customer segmentation and product recommendations.
